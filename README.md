🗺️ Geological Map – BGS 625k.

Web Map : https://mohamed-aitabdelmalik.github.io/BGS-1-625-000-Geological-Map-Adapted-Dataset-for-the-ArcGIS-Living-Atlas/

I’m pleased to share a geological map exported as a PDF, created from the BGS Geology 625k dataset and prepared for web visualization, presentation, and educational use.

The Feature Layer made available has been adapted from the original BGS 625k Geology dataset, freely available from the British Geological Survey (BGS). Geological area attributions and labels were simplified to improve readability and accessibility for a wider audience, particularly students of Earth Sciences and amateur geologists.

To maintain scientific consistency, the original LEX_RCS and LEX_ROCK codes were preserved, allowing users to reference the map directly to the official BGS 625k Geology dataset.



📌 Dataset background

BGS Geology 625k is a generalized digital geological map derived from BGS published UK poster maps.

Bedrock geology themes were generalized from 1:50,000-scale data (2007, 5th edition).

Superficial geology themes were digitized from the 1977 Quaternary map (north and south).



The dataset includes :

Bedrock Geology

Superficial Geology

Linear Features (Faults)

Geological maps form the foundation for many Earth science applications and are widely used in research, education, and spatial analysis.
